# Future ERP, PLM, and LCA Integrations

The DPP platform is designed to integrate with a variety of external enterprise systems to ingest and synchronize product data. This includes Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) tools, and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) or sustainability databases. By planning for future integrations, we ensure the platform can slot into existing enterprise IT landscapes with minimal friction. Key aspects of the integration framework include the integration models, placeholders for major vendors, and considerations for security, mapping, and sync processes.

## Integration Models (API, EDI, Middleware)

We support multiple integration models to accommodate different enterprise system capabilities:

-   **Direct API Integration**: Modern systems (ERP cloud services, PLM tools with REST APIs) can connect via our REST/GraphQL API. For example, when a product record is created or updated in the ERP, an API call can be made to the DPP platform to create/update the corresponding passport data. This model allows real-time or near real-time data sync and fine-grained control over which fields are sent.
-   **EDI/Bulk Data Exchange**: For legacy systems or batch-oriented updates, the platform supports exchanging data through files or messages (e.g., CSV, XML, or industry-standard EDI messages). A scheduled job or event can import the data into the DPP system. This is useful for nightly syncs or integrating with systems that cannot call APIs easily.
-   **Middleware/ESB Connectors**: For complex enterprise environments, using an integration middleware (Enterprise Service Bus or iPaaS like MuleSoft, Boomi, etc.) is often preferable. We provide or plan connectors for popular middleware platforms, which map and route data from ERP/PLM into our API. This decouples the integration and allows reuse of existing enterprise integration infrastructure.
-   **Manual or Semi-Automated Import**: As a fallback, we also allow manual import of data (via UI upload of spreadsheets) for smaller clients or initial onboarding, though this is not a primary method for ongoing sync.

To illustrate, the table below outlines integration methods and their typical use cases:

| Integration Method      | Use Case                                                    | Example Systems                                      | Security                                                          | Sync Frequency                               |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| API (REST/GraphQL)      | Real-time, event-driven updates; fine-grained data exchange. | Modern SaaS ERP (NetSuite), PLM cloud, custom apps.    | OAuth2 or API keys; TLS encryption; per-tenant API credentials.   | Real-time or near real-time (event-driven).  |
| EDI / File Import       | Batch updates for legacy systems or consolidated nightly loads. | Older ERP (SAP R/3 via IDoc files), supply chain systems. | Secure SFTP, PGP file encryption; integrity checks on import.     | Scheduled (e.g., nightly, weekly).           |
| Middleware (iPaaS/ESB)  | Complex multi-system orchestration; enterprise messaging.   | MuleSoft, Boomi, SAP PI/PO, Oracle Fusion Middleware. | Uses middleware’s secure channels; platform provides authenticated endpoints. | Depends on workflow (can be event-driven or batch). |
| Manual Import           | One-off or initial data population; small volume.           | CSV/XLS upload via UI by admins.                     | UI authentication; file validation in-place.                      | On demand (not automated continuous sync).   |

The platform’s Integration SDK (planned) will provide templates and code samples for each model, making it easier for client IT teams to hook up their systems.

## Major System Integration Placeholders

To future-proof the platform, we have designated placeholder modules for popular enterprise systems. These placeholders represent planned out-of-the-box connectors or integration templates:

-   **SAP Integration Module**: A placeholder for SAP ERP (such as S/4HANA or older ECC systems). This module could leverage SAP’s APIs or IDoc mechanism to pull product data (materials, BOM, compliance info) into the DPP. It will handle mapping SAP fields (e.g., material number, batch data, recycling info) to the DPP schema.
-   **Oracle Integration Module**: Placeholder for Oracle’s ERP/PLM solutions (like Oracle E-Business Suite or Oracle Cloud ERP). This might use Oracle’s REST APIs or database extracts. Key data like item attributes, regulatory compliance data stored in Oracle will sync to DPP.
-   **Siemens PLM Integration**: Placeholder aimed at Siemens Teamcenter (a common PLM) or other Siemens industrial software. It will focus on extracting product structure, composition, and lifecycle data. For instance, pulling a BOM and material composition from Teamcenter into a product passport.
-   **NetSuite Integration**: Since NetSuite (Oracle) is popular for mid-market ERP, a connector for NetSuite’s REST API is planned. It would fetch item records, component lists, and any sustainability fields tracked in NetSuite.
-   **LCA Tools Integration**: Placeholder for Life Cycle Assessment tools or databases (e.g., SimaPro, GaBi). This could import LCA results like carbon footprint or energy usage per product to include in the passport’s environmental impact section.

Each placeholder module will outline the data flow and required mapping for its target system. Initially, these act as templates – clients can implement them with our guidance. Over time, these may become fully supported connectors.

## Connection Security and Field Mapping
Any integration must uphold security and data integrity standards:
- **Secure Connections**: All data exchange uses encrypted channels (HTTPS for APIs, SFTP for file transfers). API integrations use strong authentication (OAuth 2.0 with tokens or signed API keys per tenant). For incoming connections from on-prem systems, we support IP allowlisting and mutual TLS if required.
- **Credentials Management**: Integration credentials (like API keys for an ERP or database connection strings) are stored securely (encrypted at rest in a secrets manager). Access to these credentials is limited to the integration services and not exposed to the UI.
- **Field Mapping**: Because each external system has its own data schema, a flexible mapping layer is provided. Administrators or integrators can define how fields map to the DPP schema. For example, mapping “MaterialCode” in an ERP to the DPP’s “Material ID”, or mapping an ERP’s sustainability score field to a DPP custom field. This mapping can be configured via a UI or config files (with default presets for known systems).
- **Data Transformation & Validation**: Before data is accepted, the integration layer can transform units (e.g., convert weights to standard units) and validate values (e.g., no negative weights, required fields present). This ensures that bad data doesn’t enter the passport. If a record fails validation, the platform can log the error and optionally notify the admin.
- **Sync Cadence and Monitoring**: The frequency of sync can be configured. Real-time integrations might push changes instantly; batch integrations might run nightly. The platform includes monitoring dashboards for integration health – tracking last sync time, records imported, and any errors. Alerts can be raised if an expected sync is missed or if data anomalies are detected.
- **Access Control**: Integrated data respects the same RBAC controls. For instance, data imported from an ERP into Tenant A’s workspace will only be visible to users in Tenant A with appropriate roles. There are also checks to ensure that an integration connector for one tenant cannot accidentally push data into another tenant’s workspace.
