# Future ERP, PLM, and LCA Integrations

The DPP platform is designed to integrate with a variety of external enterprise systems to ingest and synchronize product data. This includes Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) tools, and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) or sustainability databases. By planning for future integrations, we ensure the platform can slot into existing enterprise IT landscapes with minimal friction. Key aspects of the integration framework include the integration models, placeholders for major vendors, and considerations for security, mapping, and sync processes.

## Procurement-to-DPP Data Integration Workflows

Integrating Digital Product Passports into existing enterprise systems requires mapping procurement and supply chain data to the DPP schema. Procurement systems (ERP) contain much of the information needed for a DPP – e.g. materials, suppliers, batch numbers, compliance certificates for components, etc. The platform offers connectors or APIs to pull data from ERP software like SAP, Oracle, or Microsoft Dynamics and populate the passport fields.

A typical workflow could be: when a new product or batch is created in the ERP (with a bill of materials, material composition, etc.), the DPP service is triggered to generate a draft passport. It will extract key fields: product ID, lot numbers, manufacturing date/location, supplier identifiers, and any sustainability data available (for instance, if the procurement system tracks recycled content or certifications).

Many companies maintain product info in Product Information Management (PIM) or PLM systems; those can feed into DPP as well. The platform provides a configuration interface to map, say, the ERP’s “Material Group” or custom fields to the DPP’s classification taxonomy. Over time, as regulatory requirements expand, the mapping will include pulling environmental indicators (e.g. carbon footprint values from an LCA tool or a sustainability module in the ERP) into the passport automatically.

Onboarding an enterprise might involve a phase of data assessment: determining which internal data sources contain the required DPP attributes. Then the DPP platform team works with the enterprise IT to map those fields. After mapping, initial passports are generated for existing products. Going forward, processes are adjusted so that whenever procurement gets data, it is also sent to update the DPP. The platform’s API allows both pull and push: it can fetch data from ERP or the ERP can call the API when new info is available.

## Integration Models

We support multiple integration models to accommodate different enterprise system capabilities:

-   **Direct API Integration**: Modern systems (ERP cloud services, PLM tools with REST APIs) can connect via our REST/GraphQL API for real-time or near real-time data sync.
-   **Bulk Data Exchange**: For legacy systems or batch-oriented updates, the platform supports exchanging data through files (e.g., CSV, XML). A scheduled job or event can import the data. The platform supports bulk import/export for large organizations with thousands of products.
-   **Middleware/iPaaS Connectors**: For complex enterprise environments, using an integration middleware (Enterprise Service Bus or iPaaS like MuleSoft, Boomi) is often preferable. Real-time integration is ideal, and an iPaaS can efficiently comply with DPP data integration requirements by decoupling the ERP and DPP systems via a data bus that can transform and cleanse data.

## Major System Integration Placeholders

To future-proof the platform, we have designated placeholder modules for popular enterprise systems. These placeholders represent planned out-of-the-box connectors or integration templates:

-   **SAP Integration Module**: A placeholder for SAP ERP (such as S/4HANA or older ECC systems).
-   **Oracle Integration Module**: Placeholder for Oracle’s ERP/PLM solutions.
-   **Microsoft Dynamics Integration**: Placeholder for the Dynamics suite.
-   **Siemens PLM Integration**: Placeholder aimed at Siemens Teamcenter or other Siemens industrial software.
-   **LCA Tools Integration**: Placeholder for Life Cycle Assessment tools or databases (e.g., SimaPro, GaBi) to import LCA results.

## Data Governance and Security

-   **Data Quality and Validation**: The platform validates incoming data against the DPP JSON schemas. Any errors (e.g., a value out of allowed range, or a missing mandatory field) are reported so the enterprise can correct its source data. This tight integration and validation loop helps enterprises prepare for eventual regulations. By starting integration now, businesses not only achieve compliance but also unlock supply chain insights.
-   **Connection Security**: All data exchange uses encrypted channels. API integrations use strong authentication (OAuth 2.0 or API keys). For incoming connections from on-prem systems, we support IP allowlisting and mutual TLS if required.
-   **Field Mapping**: Because each external system has its own data schema, a flexible mapping layer is provided. Administrators or integrators can define how fields map to the DPP schema.
