# Enterprise Integration Architecture

## ERP and Procurement System Integration
To generate Digital Product Passports at scale, the platform should integrate with enterprise data sources like ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning), PIM (Product Information Management), and supply chain systems. The goal is to auto-generate DPPs from procurement and sourcing data with minimal manual effort. For instance, when a new product is manufactured and its details are entered in SAP or Microsoft Dynamics (typical ERP systems), those details can feed directly into a DPP issuance workflow. A recommended approach is using a PIM as a staging area for DPP data [calsoft.com](https://www.calsoft.com) [calsoft.com](https://www.calsoft.com). The PIM aggregates all relevant product information: bill of materials, supplier info, manufacturing date, compliance documents, etc. The DPP platform could periodically pull from the PIM (via API or data export) to create the digital passport in the required format. Major ERP vendors are already exploring support for DPPs; for example, Microsoft Dynamics 365 is highlighted as an ideal choice for DPP integration due to its scalability and supply chain modules [calsoft.com](https://www.calsoft.com). The integration playbook would involve mapping data fields: e.g., map the ERP’s “material composition” entries to the DPP’s sustainability section, map the ERP’s supplier IDs to the DPP’s provenance claims, etc. Using APIs is key – the platform should expose endpoints or connectors so that when a product record is finalized in the ERP, a call like CreatePassport(productID) triggers passport issuance [calsoft.com](https://www.calsoft.com). This API would gather necessary info either directly from the ERP database or from an intermediate data lake. Many enterprises might prefer a batch mode too – e.g., every night generate passports for all new or updated products. The integration should handle large volumes (millions of SKUs), so it must support bulk operations efficiently [calsoft.com](https://www.calsoft.com). Cloud-based ERP systems can help, but the DPP platform should be flexible to work with on-premises setups as well. In an SAP environment, for example, one could use SAP’s extension framework or middleware (like SAP Cloud Platform Integration) to map ECC or S/4HANA fields to the DPP schema. For Oracle or others, similar middleware or direct DB queries can be used. The platform documentation can provide playbooks for each major ERP: detailing the fields required (e.g., product identifier, batch number, weight, recycled content, compliance certificates references, etc.) and how to extract them. This ensures that generating a DPP is not a standalone task but a natural output of existing processes – when a product is marked as ready to ship in ERP, the DPP gets created and perhaps a QR code is returned to attach to the physical product. By automating via ERP integration, companies will maintain consistent and up-to-date passports without duplicate data entry, and this reduces errors significantly [calsoft.com](https://www.calsoft.com) [calsoft.com](https://www.calsoft.com). It’s also advisable to integrate PLM (Product Lifecycle Management) systems for engineering data and LIMS for any lab/test data if needed for compliance, ensuring the passport covers the full spectrum from design to production. In summary, the DPP platform acts as a layer on top of enterprise data: it should pull together data from ERP, PLM, supply chain, and ESG systems, then publish verifiable credentials. Playbooks for SAP, Dynamics, Oracle, etc., will speed up adoption by giving IT departments a clear recipe to follow.

## On-Premises vs. Hybrid Cloud Deployments & Verifiable Logs
Enterprises in regulated sectors might prefer to keep DPP infrastructure on-premises (for data control) or in a private cloud, whereas others may opt for a SaaS model. The platform needs to support both, with attention to compliance (e.g. data residency, security certifications). In on-prem or hybrid setups, one challenge is maintaining trust and auditability across environments – this is where verifiable logs and zero-knowledge proofs come into play. The platform can maintain an append-only log of all critical events (credential issued, viewed, updated, revoked) and anchor these logs in a tamper-proof way. For example, an on-prem installation at a manufacturer could write hashes of each passport event to a public or consortium blockchain (or even a company-internal blockchain) to create an immutable audit trail. This log can use zero-knowledge or hashing such that no sensitive content is exposed on the ledger – only evidence of actions. As a result, even if the main data is stored in a private database or data lake, any tampering would be detectable by comparing the data to the audit trail. Tools from the blockchain domain (similar to blockchain notarization services) can facilitate this: a component takes, say, daily snapshots or Merkle roots of all new DPP data and writes it to an Ethereum or EBSI ledger. This yields non-repudiation – a company cannot quietly modify a passport retroactively without breaking the hash chain. From a compliance view (important for investors and regulators), the system provides verifiable logs proving data integrity and changes over time [trustchain.ngi.eu](https://trustchain.ngi.eu) [trustchain.ngi.eu](https://trustchain.ngi.eu). Another aspect is zero-knowledge access control: using techniques like zk-SNARKs or trusted execution, one could allow auditors to verify certain properties of the data in the on-prem system without seeing the raw data. For instance, an auditor might want to ensure that only authorized roles have accessed a sensitive part of a passport. The system could produce a ZK proof that in the log of accesses (which is encrypted), no unauthorized ID appears – satisfying the audit without revealing actual identities. While advanced, such features might be relevant for high-security industries (defense, high-value electronics). More practically, role-based data pipelines should be established: different internal roles (sustainability officer, supply chain manager, compliance officer) might input data to the DPP at different stages. The integration architecture must ensure each role’s input is captured, traceable, and limited to their scope. For example, a compliance manager uploads a test report which gets linked in the passport, but they shouldn’t see confidential supplier pricing data which might be in another section. This calls for data partitioning in the pipeline: possibly separate microservices or channels for each category of data, all merging into the final DPP credential. The data lake (or warehouse) where all product info aggregates can still be one store, but with fine-grained access controls. We can utilize cloud infrastructure for heavy processing (e.g., generating thousands of QR codes, or running analytics on passport data) but keep sensitive master data on-prem if needed – that’s the essence of a hybrid cloud approach. Importantly, whenever data flows from on-prem to cloud or vice versa, the platform should ensure end-to-end integrity verification. By leveraging cryptographic signatures at the data item level, the provenance of each piece of information in the DPP is trackable. For instance, if a part’s recycled content is asserted by an internal system, that assertion could be signed by that system’s key. This way, the final passport is a mosaic of claims from different sources, each verifiable. Auditors or partners can then trace each claim back to origin (and if needed, request evidence). In sum, the enterprise integration architecture is secure-by-design and audit-friendly: it connects to existing enterprise data sources, runs in whatever IT environment the company chooses (with cloud components for scalability as desired), and produces verifiable, traceable outputs. Zero-knowledge techniques and verifiable logs give management and investors peace of mind that even in a distributed setup, nothing can be hidden or altered without detection [trustchain.ngi.eu](https://trustchain.ngi.eu). This is crucial for investor-readiness – proving that the platform can support rigorous compliance audits (financial or regulatory) without requiring full trust in any single party’s database.

## Data Lake Compatibility and Traceability
As companies gather vast amounts of product data for DPPs, storing and analyzing this information becomes a big data challenge. The DPP platform should integrate with data lakes (e.g., Amazon S3-based lake, Azure Data Lake, or on-prem Hadoop systems) to store both raw and processed passport data. A data lake allows organizations to run analytics – for instance, to find trends in material usage across all passports, or to quickly retrieve all passports affected by a certain supplier. The platform can feed the lake with JSON-LD credential data, which can then be transformed for BI tools. Ensuring traceability in this context means that any data pulled from the lake for decision-making can be traced back to the original credential and ultimately to the source system. Each record in the lake might carry the credential ID, the issuer, timestamps, and even the blockchain transaction ID of its anchor, so that no matter where the data goes, it carries an audit trail. This is extremely useful if an issue arises (say a recall of a product): one can query the lake for all products with a certain component batch number and then follow those to specific passports and transactions, providing proof for stakeholders. Moreover, the schema of the data should remain consistent with industry standards so data lake aggregation from multiple companies or divisions is possible. Using formats like JSON-LD and backing by ontologies (e.g., Schema.org or industry schemas) will help compatibility. The role-based access mentioned above extends to the data lake too – some data (like trade secrets) might be in a restricted zone of the lake, accessible only to certain analysts. It might be that sensitive fields in passports are encrypted or redacted before the data lake ingestion, with keys only available to certain analysts. As for life-cycle traceability, the platform could maintain a separate event stream (like an Apache Kafka topic or similar) where each event (manufacture, sale, repair, recycling) related to a product is published. This stream can feed into the data lake or a graph database to map the product’s journey. By combining credential data with event logs, one achieves full traceability: you can reconstruct what happened to each product, when, and who attested it, all in a verifiable manner. For example, a regulator could query: “show me all passports of electronics where a refurbisher updated the passport” and get not only the list but cryptographic proof of each update event. This kind of powerful query and traceability is a selling point for both compliance and optimizing operations (circular economy loops etc.). In conclusion, the enterprise integration architecture ensures that the DPP isn’t an isolated system – it lives within the enterprise IT fabric, drawing from authoritative sources and feeding into analytical stores. By doing so, it enhances data governance (one version of truth for product data) and unlocks value beyond compliance – companies can drive insights from passport data (like carbon hotspot analysis, supplier performance correlations, etc.) using their existing big data tools, all while maintaining end-to-end trust and traceability in the data pipeline.
