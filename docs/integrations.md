# Future ERP, PLM, and LCA Integrations

The DPP platform is designed to integrate with a variety of external enterprise systems to ingest and synchronize product data. This includes Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) tools, and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) or sustainability databases. By planning for future integrations, we ensure the platform can slot into existing enterprise IT landscapes with minimal friction. Key aspects of the integration framework include the integration models, placeholders for major vendors, and considerations for security, mapping, and sync processes.

## Procurement-to-DPP Data Integration Workflows

Integrating Digital Product Passports into existing enterprise systems requires mapping procurement and supply chain data to the DPP schema. Procurement systems (ERP) contain much of the information needed for a DPP – e.g. materials, suppliers, batch numbers, compliance certificates for components, etc. The platform offers connectors or APIs to pull data from ERP software like SAP, Oracle, or Microsoft Dynamics and populate the passport fields.

A typical workflow could be: when a new product or batch is created in the ERP (with a bill of materials, material composition, etc.), the DPP service is triggered to generate a draft passport. It will extract key fields: product ID, lot numbers, manufacturing date/location, supplier identifiers, and any sustainability data available (for instance, if the procurement system tracks recycled content or certifications).

Many companies maintain product info in Product Information Management (PIM) or PLM systems; those can feed into DPP as well. The platform provides a configuration interface to map, say, the ERP’s “Material Group” or custom fields to the DPP’s classification taxonomy. Over time, as regulatory requirements expand, the mapping will include pulling environmental indicators (e.g. carbon footprint values from an LCA tool or a sustainability module in the ERP) into the passport automatically.

Onboarding an enterprise might involve a phase of data assessment: determining which internal data sources contain the required DPP attributes. Then the DPP platform team works with the enterprise IT to map those fields. After mapping, initial passports are generated for existing products. Going forward, processes are adjusted so that whenever procurement gets data, it is also sent to update the DPP. The platform’s API allows both pull and push: it can fetch data from ERP or the ERP can call the API when new info is available.

## Integration Models

We support multiple integration models to accommodate different enterprise system capabilities:

-   **Direct API Integration**: Modern systems (ERP cloud services, PLM tools with REST APIs) can connect via our REST/GraphQL API for real-time or near real-time data sync.
-   **Bulk Data Exchange**: For legacy systems or batch-oriented updates, the platform supports exchanging data through files (e.g., CSV, XML). A scheduled job or event can import the data. The platform supports bulk import/export for large organizations with thousands of products.
-   **Middleware/iPaaS Connectors**: For complex enterprise environments, using an integration middleware (Enterprise Service Bus or iPaaS like MuleSoft, Boomi) is often preferable. Real-time integration is ideal, and an iPaaS can efficiently comply with DPP data integration requirements by decoupling the ERP and DPP systems via a data bus that can transform and cleanse data.

## Major System Integration Placeholders

To future-proof the platform, we have designated placeholder modules for popular enterprise systems. These placeholders represent planned out-of-the-box connectors or integration templates:

-   **SAP Integration Module**: A placeholder for SAP ERP (such as S/4HANA or older ECC systems).
-   **Oracle Integration Module**: Placeholder for Oracle’s ERP/PLM solutions.
-   **Microsoft Dynamics Integration**: Placeholder for the Dynamics suite.
-   **Siemens PLM Integration**: Placeholder aimed at Siemens Teamcenter or other Siemens industrial software.
-   **LCA Tools Integration**: Placeholder for Life Cycle Assessment tools or databases (e.g., SimaPro, GaBi) to import LCA results.

## Data Governance and Security

-   **Data Quality and Validation**: The platform validates incoming data against the DPP JSON schemas. Any errors (e.g., a value out of allowed range, or a missing mandatory field) are reported so the enterprise can correct its source data. This tight integration and validation loop helps enterprises prepare for eventual regulations. By starting integration now, businesses not only achieve compliance but also unlock supply chain insights.
-   **Connection Security**: All data exchange uses encrypted channels. API integrations use strong authentication (OAuth 2.0 or API keys). For incoming connections from on-prem systems, we support IP allowlisting and mutual TLS if required.
-   **Field Mapping**: Because each external system has its own data schema, a flexible mapping layer is provided. Administrators or integrators can define how fields map to the DPP schema.

## SSO Integration and Fine-Grained Access Control
In large organizations, the DPP platform must integrate with corporate Single Sign-On (SSO) systems for seamless and secure user access. The platform should support OAuth2/OpenID Connect and SAML2.0 protocols to connect with identity providers (IdPs) like Azure AD, Okta, Auth0, or corporate Active Directory Federation Services. During enterprise onboarding, the IT admins should be able to configure the DPP platform as a Service Provider (SP) in a SAML trust or as an OIDC client. This allows users to log in with their existing corporate credentials and multi-factor authentication, improving security and user convenience. For example, an employee at ACME Corp clicking on the DPP portal would be redirected to ACME’s SSO login, then back to the DPP app with a valid session. This also facilitates automatic user provisioning via SCIM or JIT provisioning if supported – meaning user accounts and roles in the DPP platform can be managed centrally. Once users are in, fine-grained access control is crucial. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is the baseline: define roles such as DPP Administrator, Issuer, Viewer, Auditor, Supplier User, etc., and assign permissions like “create passport”, “revoke passport”, “view all passports”, “view only own department’s passports,” etc. In a multi-tenant environment (where one instance serves multiple organizations or divisions), roles must be scoped per tenant. For example, Admin of Company A can manage only Company A’s data, and cannot see Company B’s passports. The platform should enforce a tenant context with every permission check, so even if two tenants have an “Engineer” role, an engineer from tenant X cannot access tenant Y’s products. However, enterprise needs often go beyond simple RBAC. Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) adds flexibility by considering user attributes, resource attributes, and context in decisions. For instance, you might want to allow Quality Managers to edit passports only for products in their plant or only for electronics category but not chemicals. ABAC can handle this by evaluating attributes like user.department == passport.plantDepartment or passport.category == "electronics" in access policies. The DPP platform can integrate with ABAC policy engines (like Open Policy Agent or XACML-based engines) to externalize these rules. Another advanced model is ReBAC (Relationship-Based Access Control) for supply-chain scenarios: e.g., a supplier user can only see the part of the passport relevant to their component – which is based on a relationship mapping between that supplier and certain data fields. From a practical standpoint, an enterprise admin portal in the DPP platform should allow assignment of roles and perhaps definition of custom roles or policies. This ties into SSO groups: often roles can be linked to SSO groups/claims. For example, if a user’s SAML assertion contains Department=Chemicals, the platform could auto-restrict their access to the Chemical products area via ABAC rules. Likewise, integration with OAuth2 scopes could allow API clients (machine-to-machine) to be limited in what they can do. Auditing is part of access control: all user actions (issuing a passport, editing data, viewing sensitive fields) should be logged with user ID and timestamp. This is essential for compliance and insider threat monitoring. In summary, SSO integration ensures only authorized personnel from the company can access the DPP system without managing separate passwords, and their access can be revoked via the corporate directory if needed. RBAC provides clear role separation (e.g., only designated compliance officers can approve a passport release). ABAC provides the nuanced control needed in large orgs – for example, making sure a factory manager only edits data for their factory’s products, or a regional officer only views data for their region. By combining these, the platform supports fine-grained Role and Attribute-Based Access Control suitable for complex organizational structures.

## Private Tenants, Hybrid Deployments, and Compliance Isolation
Different enterprises have varying requirements for data isolation and deployment. A flexible DPP platform should accommodate multi-tenant SaaS as well as private deployments. In a multi-tenant cloud setup, each organization’s data is logically isolated but hosted on shared infrastructure (with proper ACLs as discussed). However, some companies – due to strict compliance (e.g., in chemicals or defense) – might demand a single-tenant (private) instance, either in a separate cloud environment or on-premises. The platform should offer private tenant options, essentially a dedicated stack for that client, ensuring complete data separation at the infrastructure level and giving the client control over data residency. This can be framed as “Hosted Private Cloud” or on-premises deployment.

The documentation and architecture should highlight how the tenant data is isolated: separate databases or schemas per tenant, encryption of data at rest with tenant-specific keys, and no commingling of records. In a private deployment, even the application might be deployed separately for the client. This not only aids compliance (some regulations require data to not be stored in a multi-tenant database or in certain jurisdictions) but also can improve performance for a large enterprise by not contending with others.

For hybrid cloud setups, consider that some sensitive components (like a Material Substance database) might remain on the company’s own servers, while the DPP web interface and blockchain connectivity run in the cloud. The platform can support hybrid by having modular services – e.g., a local on-prem connector that holds confidential data (like proprietary formulas or customer lists) and only publishes hashes or necessary info to the cloud passport. This way, truly sensitive info never leaves the company’s environment, yet the passport in the cloud can be verified and shared. Hybrid models can also be useful for scaling: e.g., caching or processing large files (CAD drawings, etc.) on-prem while using the cloud for sharing references.

Governance and compliance separation goes beyond raw data isolation. Tenants may need custom retention policies (one company might require all passport data be deleted after X years or exportable for archival), or custom compliance workflows. For instance, a chemical company might require that any passport goes through an internal compliance review step before it’s considered “issued.” The platform should allow some degree of configurability per tenant: custom approval workflows, custom field visibility (maybe a tenant can define additional private fields visible only to them and their partners), and integration with their compliance systems.

Audit traceability is crucial here: each tenant (company) should have access to audit logs of all actions on their data. In a multi-tenant deployment, ensure that each tenant can only see their slice of the audit log. In a private deployment, the entire log is theirs. Audit logs should record events like “User X from Org Y updated field Z on passport ABC at time T” and “User Q viewed passport ABC at time T”. These logs might themselves be verifiable (one could even anchor them on a blockchain or immutable store for additional integrity).

Another aspect is governance: enterprises might want granular control over who in their tenant can share data externally. For example, a passport might have a public part and a confidential part. A company might set rules that only a corporate admin can mark a passport as publishable externally. The platform should facilitate such governance by providing toggles for data visibility (public vs consortium vs internal). The governance model might also involve consortium features: perhaps multiple companies collaborate on one product’s passport (common in complex supply chains). A robust DPP system allows a “federated” or consortium tenant where each party sees only what they contributed plus a combined public view.

Compliance separation also means ensuring that if two tenants have potentially conflicting regulatory needs, the system can cater to both without interference. One example: encryption keys – one tenant might require holding their encryption keys (for encrypting certain data fields) under their control. The platform could integrate with external key management so that tenant’s data is encrypted with keys they control (Bring Your Own Key). Another example: if one tenant falls under GDPR and requests data deletion, it should not impact others. Multi-tenant software must be designed and documented to handle such isolated operations reliably.

Lastly, audit traceability is not only internal – it’s also for external auditors or regulators. The platform should make it easy to produce reports showing who accessed or changed what data and when, satisfying typical regulatory audits (for example, demonstrating that only authorized roles accessed certain hazardous material information). Possibly integrate with SIEM (Security Info and Event Management) systems of the enterprise or provide export of logs in a compliant format.

In summary, enterprise onboarding in advanced scenarios will often require spinning up a dedicated environment (tenant) with configurations tailored to that enterprise’s policies. This could be a logically separated tenant in the SaaS or a completely isolated deployment. The DPP platform’s architecture accounts for this with modular components that can be deployed per-tenant, and strong isolation guarantees (both in code – tenant IDs everywhere – and in data storage – separate schemas or databases). Providing this flexibility helps address the needs of highly regulated industries that might otherwise be unable to adopt a shared service. It also appeals to IT integrators who might offer the platform as part of a larger solution with specific deployment architectures.
