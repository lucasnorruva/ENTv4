# Digital Product Passport Platform – Future-Ready Innovations

## Tokenization & Circular Economy Credits

Products can be linked to on-chain “eco‐tokens” that represent sustainability value. For example, a DPP might record a product’s carbon footprint and automatically offset it by purchasing blockchain-based carbon credits (e.g. via Toucan or KlimaDAO). Carbon tokens on public ledgers are transparently traceable and “programmable” – effectively a composable “money Lego” for climate action. Likewise, DPPs could issue recyclability or repair tokens: when a consumer returns or repairs an item, a smart contract mints a token reward (or NFT badge) that can be traded or redeemed for benefits. Brands could gamify these rewards (e.g. deposit-refund tokens instead of cash) to strengthen loyalty and advance circularity. Over time, token incentives can be dynamically tuned: machine‑learning-driven contracts could boost rewards for recycling when raw-material supply is low, or shift tokens to promote reuse during low-demand periods.

### Tradable Climate Assets
Encode product carbon or material attributes as blockchain tokens (carbon credit tokens, eco-score NFTs, recyclability badges). For example, a product’s lifecycle emissions could be routinely offset on-chain by retiring Toucan/Verra-based carbon tokens.

### Token Economics for Circularity
Use token rewards to incentivize repair, reuse, and return. Consumers earn tokens for extending product life; producers earn for designing easily recyclable goods. These tokens can feed loyalty programs or be tradeable on secondary markets.

### Integration with Carbon Registries
DPP systems should interoperate with established Web3 carbon platforms. For instance, KlimaDAO and Toucan Protocol bridge voluntary carbon credits on-chain, letting smart contracts automatically retire the right amount of carbon tokens based on DPP-recorded emissions. Such bridging ensures any claimed offset in a DPP is backed by a blockchain-verifiable credit.

### Dynamic Smart Contracts
Embedded smart contracts monitor DPP data (e.g. usage, recycling status) and issue or burn tokens accordingly. The system can adjust parameters in real time: e.g. increase recycling reward tokens if IoT sensors in a region show high material demand, or decrease them when stockpiles grow. This enables a feedback-driven token economy that aligns with actual lifecycle conditions and circularity goals.

## Advanced Identity Models

A robust DPP platform must tie digital credentials to strong, user-controlled identity. We envision hardware-backed DIDs: each user’s private keys for their product passport (or credential wallet) are stored in a secure enclave or TPM on their device, unlocked via biometric or PIN. This prevents key exfiltration and ensures only a valid device/user can sign DPP transactions. Both Web3 wallets (e.g. MetaMask, WalletConnect) and enterprise identity solutions (FIDO2, YubiKey) should integrate, so suppliers, recyclers, and consumers can seamlessly present and verify DPP credentials. To align with evolving standards, our DPP IDs will interoperate with the EU’s upcoming eIDAS 2.0 digital wallets. The European Digital Identity (EUDI) Wallet will adopt a blockchain-based self-sovereign model, letting citizens store verifiable IDs (passports, licenses, certificates) without a central issuer. Likewise, our platform’s DID/VC architecture will be compatible with eIDAS’ trust framework. In practice, a supplier could register with their national eIDAS wallet or another SSI wallet, and then use that same DID to issue DPP attestations. This bridges cross-border trust: an EU-registered producer and an African recycler (via the African Circular Economy Alliance) could mutually verify credentials under each region’s rules. Governance of DIDs is also critical. Loss or compromise of a device’s key must not break the system. We will adopt SSI recovery patterns: each identity can designate delegates or guardians (e.g. corporate admin, consortium members) who can co-sign recovery transactions. For example, popular DID systems (uPort, Sovrin) allow a quorum of delegates to rotate out a lost key. Likewise, DPP-issued credentials (verifiable certificates of material origin, etc.) will include built-in revocation mechanisms. Issuers can publish cryptographic revocation registries (or status lists) on a ledger so verifiers can immediately check if a credential is still valid. This ensures any credential (a compliance certificate, EPR deposit receipt, etc.) can be instantly annulled across jurisdictions when needed.

### Hardware-Tethered DIDs
Store private keys in secure hardware (TPM, Secure Enclave) unlocked by biometrics/PIN. This makes each DID tied to a physical device, preventing key theft. It mirrors FIDO2/WebAuthn “passwordless” login but for DPP wallets.

### Wallet Integration
Support mainstream SSI wallets (MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, enterprise wallets) so all stakeholders can manage their DPP credentials. Suppliers use corporate DID wallets for attesting compliance; consumers use personal SSI wallets to store product VCs. Verifiable Presentations are generated on-demand from these wallets when proving a claim (like product origin) to a stakeholder.

### eIDAS 2.0 & SSI Alignment
The EU’s EUDI Wallet (per eIDAS 2.0) and Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) share the same goal: user-controlled, cross-border identity. By adopting DID methods recognized in the EUDI framework, our DPP credentials become directly compatible with EU wallets. Similarly, for exporters/importers in ASEAN or Africa, regional identity schemes (e.g. pan-Africa eID initiatives) can map to these decentralized IDs. In short, one DID can carry both EU-regulated identities and global SSI credentials.

### Recovery/Delegation & Governance
We will implement decentralized governance for DIDs. Enterprises issuing DPP credentials will define policies for DID rotation and revocation. Users can designate a set of trustees/delegates who can vouch to recover a lost key (as in CSIRO’s “Delegate List” pattern). Credential issuers will manage clear procedures for revocation (e.g. status lists) and recovery (e.g. multi-signature DID updates). All identity operations are auditable, on-chain, to provide trust without central authorities.
