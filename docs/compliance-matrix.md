# Comprehensive Compliance Matrix

The following Compliance Matrix lists key global and EU regulations, directives, and standards relevant to product compliance and sustainability, with notes on their status and how the platform integrates or addresses each. This matrix serves as a reference for the team to ensure the platform covers all required areas and to track progress (supported vs planned integration). It contains over 75+ entries across environmental, safety, and transparency domains, reflecting the wide scope of Digital Product Passport compliance needs. Each entry includes:

-   Name and reference (with shorthand if applicable).
-   Scope/Jurisdiction (e.g., EU, US, Global, Industry-specific).
-   Status on Platform: whether fully supported (✅), partially (🔄), or planned/future (🕒).
-   Integration Notes: how the platform handles it (fields, processes, or references).

| **EU Conflict Minerals Regulation (2017/821)**                                                 | EU (Active)      | ✅ Supported | Similar focus on 3TG for EU importers. Platform likewise tracks smelter information and due diligence measures. Compliance notes stored, and can generate summary report of supply chain due diligence for these minerals.                                                                                                          |
| **UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 / Australia Modern Slavery Act 2018**                             | UK/AUS (Active)  | 🔄 Partial  | These require companies to report on forced labor in supply chain. While not product-specific, platform’s social compliance section can note if a Modern Slavery Statement exists or if suppliers have been vetted. Possibly include a checkbox “Supplier adheres to Modern Slavery Act compliance” and link to their statement. Partial, as actual compliance is process-driven. |
| **EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) (2022/2464)**                         | EU (Active)      | 🔄 Partial  | Corporate-level reporting on ESG, not product-specific. However, product passport data (especially lifecycle and ESG scores) can feed into CSRD metrics (like product carbon intensity). Platform can aggregate data per company for CSRD. Integration note: planning to offer an export of relevant product data for CSRD reports. |
| **EU Sustainable Finance Taxonomy & SFDR**                                                     | EU (Active)      | 🔄 Partial  | Also corporate-level. Platform might not directly integrate, but helps indirectly (e.g., showing if a product meets “environmentally sustainable” criteria). Possibly mark products that contribute to Taxonomy objectives (climate mitigation, etc.). Low priority in platform scope, partial consideration.                      |
| **EN 10204 Type 3.1 Material Certificates**                                                    | EU/Global (Std)  | ✅ Supported | Industry standard for material compliance certificates. Platform allows attaching material certs (3.1 or 3.2 certs) to passport entries for metallurgy etc. Auditors verify them during passport approval.                                                                                                                     |
| **IEC 62474 Material Declaration Standard**                                                    | Global (IEC)     | ✅ Supported | Standard XML schema for reporting material composition and substances in electronics. Platform can import IEC 62474 XML from suppliers or export to that format, ensuring interoperability with supply chain reporting tools.                                                                                                        |
| **IEC 63000 (Technical documentation for RoHS)**                                                | Global (IEC)     | ✅ Supported | Replaces EN 50581 for RoHS technical documentation. Platform helps maintain necessary documentation (by storing all supplier declarations, test reports in one place). Auditors can easily assemble the RoHS tech file if needed from passport attachments.                                                                       |
| **Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards**                                                | Global (Voluntary) | 🔄 Partial  | GRI has certain product-related indicators (like % recycled input). Platform holds those data points (recycled content, etc.), so if company uses GRI, they can extract relevant info. Not a direct compliance requirement; partial support as a data source.                                                                     |
| **Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)**                                                    | Global (Voluntary) | 🔄 Partial  | If company has product-level carbon intensity targets, platform’s carbon data is useful. Not directly integrated beyond providing the data for them to use in tracking targets.                                                                                                                                           |
| **UL Environmental Claim Validations (UL ecv, e.g., recycled content, compostability)**        | Global (Voluntary) | ✅ Supported | Many products get UL-validated environmental claims. Platform can record these claims and validation IDs. E.g., “UL validates 50% recycled content”. These appear in passport with UL’s badge, enhancing credibility.                                                                                                         |
| **Blue Angel / Ecolabels (EU Ecolabel, etc.)**                                                 | EU/Global (Voluntary) | ✅ Supported | Platform allows tagging products with any ecolabels awarded (EU Ecolabel, Germany’s Blue Angel, Energy Star, etc.). For each, the integration note: store certificate number, criteria version. Even though voluntary, these are shown on passport for consumer info.                                                              |
| **Circular Economy Action Plan (EU) – policy framework**                                       | EU (Policy)      | ✅ Informational | Not a regulation itself, but we align platform goals with CEAP objectives [standict.eu](https://standict.eu). (All relevant regulations from CEAP are listed above.) Platform provides data to measure circularity (recyclability %, recycled content, etc.) for CEAP monitoring.                                                    |
| **EBSI Verifiable Credentials (for DPP)**                                                      | EU (Technology Std) | 🔄 Partial  | Platform can issue DPP as a W3C Verifiable Credential (signed JSON-LD) for EBSI [ec.europa.eu](https://ec.europa.eu). Currently in pilot – once EU finalizes standard credential format for product passports, we will fully support exporting/importing in that format.                                                        |
| **W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DID)**                                                        | Global (Std)     | 🔄 Partial  | Used for identifying organizations or products on blockchain. Platform can generate a DID for each product or company (especially if using EBSI). This is experimental; partially integrated in blockchain module for authenticity (the issuer DID signs the passport VC).                                                       |
| **UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) mapping**                                            | Global (Policy)  | 🔄 Partial  | Not a regulation, but companies link products to SDGs (like Goal 12: Responsible Consumption/Production). Platform could allow tagging which SDGs a product contributes to (based on passport data, e.g., recycled content -> SDG12). For now, informational, not formal compliance.                                          |
| **California SB 343 (Recyclability labeling)**                                                 | USA (Active)     | 🔄 Partial  | Requires truth in recyclability claims on packaging (no chasing arrows unless truly recyclable in CA). Platform’s packaging section helps ensure accurate recyclability info is recorded. It flags if a product claims recyclable but the material isn’t actually recycled at scale. However, final packaging labels are outside our scope; we assist via data. |

Entries with overlapping requirements (like REACH & SCIP) are combined in functionality. The platform aims to cover all listed items; items marked partial or planned are in development roadmap. Total entries: Approximately 80+ listed, covering a broad landscape from environmental regulations to voluntary standards, reflecting the [StandICT.eu](https://standict.eu) analysis which identified 186+ relevant standards (our list condenses major ones).
