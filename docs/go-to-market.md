# 8. Vertical-Specific Go-to-Market (GTM) and Regulatory Mapping
Electronics and Textiles (ESPR) Alignment: Under the EU’s Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR), electronics and textiles are among the first sectors slated for mandatory digital product passports. The DPP platform needs to map its data fields to the requirements of these verticals. For electronics (e.g. smartphones, appliances), key fields likely include energy efficiency data, repairability scores, and hazardous substance content. For textiles, the focus is on fiber composition, origin, and recyclability. The core DPP data model can accommodate these via extensible fields or linked resources.

Chemical Products (REACH/BPR) Mapping: The platform can accommodate chemical safety and compliance information for complex chemical products or mixtures. This includes fields for Chemical Composition (CAS numbers), Safety Data (CLP hazard statements), and Regulatory Authorizations (REACH registration, BPR approval). Integration with ECHA’s databases can ensure consistency of substance identifiers and flag SVHCs.

Construction Products (CPR) Mapping: The Construction Products Regulation (CPR) requires a Declaration of Performance (DoP). The DPP platform can digitize the DoP, including fields for mechanical properties, fire resistance, thermal performance, and harmonized standard numbers. This provides a digital twin for construction projects, allowing easy access to component specifications.

Stakeholder Journey Mapping per Vertical:
- **Batteries**: Manufacturers issue a Battery Passport. EV producers might incorporate it. Importers ensure its completeness for customs. Recyclers scan it to see composition and update its end-of-life status. The platform must facilitate these interactions, including due diligence credentials.
- **Textiles**: A certifier issues a credential for raw materials (e.g., organic certificate VC). The garment manufacturer pulls this credential into the DPP. The brand makes it available via QR code. A consumer scans it to see sustainability info. The platform must support this chain of credentials.

Regulatory Field Mapping Examples:
- **EU Battery Passport**: Requires battery identifiers, manufacturer info, chemistry, performance metrics, carbon footprint, recycled content, and due diligence info. Our data model must have slots for all these.
- **Textiles (ESPR)**: Likely fields include material breakdown, supplier identity, product environmental footprint (PEF), durability (number of washes), and a repairability index.
- **Construction (CPR)**: All properties from the DoP, plus an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD), which can be incorporated in a standardized way.

Industry Partnerships and Ecosystem Acceleration:
- **GS1**: Use GS1 identifiers (GTIN) and GS1 Digital Link for QR codes to ensure interoperability and scalability.
- **ECHA (European Chemicals Agency)**: Partner to connect the DPP platform with ECHA’s databases for substance verification and hazard information.
- **ZVEI & Industry Associations**: Collaborate with bodies like ZVEI (German Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers’ Association) to align with manufacturing standards like the Asset Administration Shell (AAS) and pilot the DPP with member companies.

By mapping regulations to DPP fields and engaging the right partners, the platform becomes future-proof. As new laws come into force, the underlying architecture remains the same; only the schema and templates expand.
