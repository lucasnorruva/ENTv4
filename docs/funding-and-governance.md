## Governance & Trust Design

### üîí Roles & Verification Layers

-   **Supplier**: Submits product data

-   **Compliance Officer**: Manages pathways
-   **Certifying Body**: Anchors 3rd-party claims (via VC)

### üßæ Data Integrity & Provenance

-   Immutable audit logs for product updates
-   Gemini AI decision audit trail (explainable prompts)
-   EBSI integration for Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)

## Investor and EU-Scale Readiness

### Scalability Metrics
The platform is designed to scale horizontally and elastically. In testing, a Fabric-like permissioned network achieved ~0.5‚Äì1 tx/sec for basic writes (roughly 2s per transaction) on modest hardware. Reads by identifier remained fast regardless of ledger size. After adding a CouchDB index for lookups by DID or external key, query latency stayed ~10 ms even with 1,000,000+ records. In practice, moving to higher-throughput L2 chains (e.g. Polygon PoS handles thousands of TPS) or sharded networks can boost these numbers orders of magnitude. Containerizing service modules (each DPP microservice, AI worker, or compliance engine) allows autoscaling on cloud platforms. Cost estimates are a function of chain fees and cloud usage: for example, anchoring a hash on Polygon currently costs only cents, while an EBSI anchor is in the same order per transaction. A cluster can support hundreds of thousands of SKUs per tenant by partitioning data (e.g. one database per region) and sharding the ledger.

### Rollout Plan
We follow a phased deployment.
- **MVP**: Validate with a pilot (e.g. one industry) using core features: DPP creation, JSON-LD VC issuance, simple blockchain anchoring, basic RBAC.
- **SME phase**: Onboard small and medium businesses with multi-tenant SaaS on public cloud, adding guided UX and compliance wizards.
- **Midmarket**: Integrate with ERP systems, support more product categories, add advanced analytics and audit features.
- **Enterprise**: Deploy private cloud or hybrid options, SSO integration (SAML/OAuth), fine-grained ABAC, extensive SLAs, and enterprise-grade PKI integration.
- **Multinational**: Enable cross-border use, multilingual interfaces and support global standards (ISO AAS, etc.).
- **Consortia/Standards**: Finally, we participate in industry consortia to codify interoperability (e.g. GS1 DPP standards) and offer our platform as a reference implementation.

### Modular Architecture
The system is built as plug-and-play modules. Key modules include:
- **Compliance Engine**: Validates DPP data against regulations (REACH, RoHS, ESPR, battery rules, etc.).
- **AI/ML Module**: Provides intelligent BOM inference, anomaly detection, and language explainability.
- **Anchoring Service**: Handles blockchain transactions on EBSI and public chains.
- **Credential Issuer**: Builds and signs W3C VCs/VPs, connected to EBSI nodes.
- **UI/UX Frontend**: Web dashboards (tenant-specific) for data entry and tracking, with ABAC enforcement.
- **Audit & Ledger Store**: Immutable store of past DPP versions, logs, and signature proofs.
- **i18n Module**: Localizes labels and compliance rules (e.g. different EU languages and regs).

Each module communicates via APIs. For example, the frontend calls the Compliance Engine before finalizing a DPP, and the Anchoring Service asynchronously logs the VC‚Äôs root hash on-chain. This modular design enables adding new functionality easily: one could plug in a ‚ÄúCircularity Report‚Äù widget or swap a blockchain provider without rewriting the core.

### Market (TAM/SAM/SOM) Alignment
The addressable market is immense. Global circular economy value is projected to reach ~$4.5 trillion by 2030, driven by regulations and resource constraints. The DPP software market alone is forecasted to grow from ~$186M in 2024 to ~$1.78B by 2030 (CAGR 45.7%), fueled by EU mandates (ESPR, Battery Directive, etc.) that will require DPPs in industries like automotive, electronics and textiles. Given this, our Total Addressable Market (TAM) includes all regulated goods producers in EU/UK/US. The Serviceable Available Market (SAM) is narrower (initially EU product categories subject to DPP rules). The Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM) is our expected share via partner channels and compliance mandates. By focusing on configurable compliance modules and enterprise integration, we aim to capture a significant portion of the EU regulatory compliance tools market, which analysts note is expanding rapidly under the Circular Economy agenda. Each of these figures and forecasts underlines why robust technical scalability, regulatory certification (e.g. EUDI Wallet conformance), and clear business alignment are critical for investor confidence.

### Sources
We cite relevant industry and EU sources, including the UN Transparency Protocol for DPPs, GS1 and ZVEI architecture guides, EBSI project documentation, and market research reports, as well as sample code patterns. These inform our design choices and ensure alignment with open standards and regulations.
