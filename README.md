# Norruva: Digital Product Passport Platform

The Norruva platform is an enterprise-grade, blockchain-anchored DPP-as-a-Service solution. Built for global scale and EU compliance, our platform enables manufacturers, brands, and supply chain partners to create, manage, and verify digital product passports with robust security and consumer-friendly accessibility.

## Vision
To democratize sustainability and compliance by providing the world's most robust, scalable, and interoperable Digital Product Passport infrastructure â€” enabling every product to carry its complete digital identity from cradle to grave while creating new circular economy opportunities.

## Key Features

-   **AI-Powered Intelligence**: Leverage Google's Gemini models via Genkit for automated compliance checking against 75+ regulations, dynamic ESG scoring, supply chain risk assessment, and auto-generation of product descriptions and compliance summaries.
-   **Enterprise Security**: Built on a zero-trust architecture with end-to-end encryption. All data integrity is secured via blockchain anchoring for immutable proof of authenticity.
-   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: A multi-tenant system with distinct dashboards and granular permissions for various roles like Suppliers, Auditors, Compliance Managers, and more.
-   **Seamless Integration**: A developer-friendly REST API, webhook system for real-time notifications, and connectors for integration with external ERPs, supply chain software, or e-commerce platforms.

## Tech Stack

-   **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (with App Router)
-   **Backend**: Local Mock Data (for development), [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) (for production)
-   **AI & Machine Learning**: [Genkit](https://firebase.google.com/docs/genkit) for leveraging Google Gemini models for content analysis and enrichment.
-   **Blockchain & Trust Layer**: [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) for low-cost, energy-efficient Ethereum Layer 2 anchoring and smart contracts for immutable verification.
-   **UI**: [React](https://reactjs.org/), [ShadCN UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
-   **Testing**: [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/)

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project running on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18 or later)
-   npm or yarn
-   Firebase CLI (`npm install -g firebase-tools`)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-name>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    
3.  **Set up Environment:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project. For local development, this file can be mostly empty, but it's required. For production deployment, you will need to add your Firebase configuration keys.
    ```bash
    touch .env
    ```
    Your `.env` file should look like this:
    ```env
    # Firebase client configuration (for production)
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=...
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=...
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=...
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=...
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=...
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=...
    
    # Secret for securing cron job endpoints
    CRON_SECRET=...
    
    # (Optional) Blockchain Integration Variables for Data Anchoring
    # You will need these to test the blockchain anchoring feature.
    # Get a free RPC URL from providers like Alchemy or Infura for the Polygon Amoy testnet.
    POLYGON_AMOY_RPC_URL=...
    # The private key of the wallet that will pay for testnet gas fees.
    # IMPORTANT: Use a dedicated, testnet-only wallet with minimal funds.
    WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=...
    # The address of your deployed smart contract on the Amoy testnet.
    # A sample contract is not provided, but the code expects a contract
    # with a `registerPassport(bytes32, bytes32)` function.
    SMART_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=...
    ```
    > **Important Note:** This `.env` file is locked and cannot be modified by the AI assistant. Please manage your environment variables manually.

### Running the Application

For local development, the application now runs entirely on mock data, so you no longer need to run the `seed` script or Firebase emulators.

To run the full application, including the Next.js frontend and the Genkit AI server, use a single command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command concurrently starts two processes:
-   **Genkit Server**: Runs the AI flows and makes them available. The Genkit Developer UI can be accessed at `http://localhost:4000`.
-   **Next.js Frontend**: Runs the main web application. The dashboard can be accessed at `http://localhost:9002`.

Both services will run in the same terminal, and you will see logs from both.

## Testing

The platform includes a testing suite using Jest.

-   **Run all tests in watch mode:**
    ```bash
    npm run test
    ```
-   **Run tests for a CI environment (single run):**
    ```bash
    npm run test:ci
    ```
