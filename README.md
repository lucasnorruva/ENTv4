# Norruva: Digital Product Passport Platform

The Norruva platform is an enterprise-grade, blockchain-anchored DPP-as-a-Service solution. Built for global scale and EU compliance, our platform enables manufacturers, brands, and supply chain partners to create, manage, and verify digital product passports with robust security and consumer-friendly accessibility.

## Vision
To democratize sustainability and compliance by providing the world's most robust, scalable, and interoperable Digital Product Passport infrastructure â€” enabling every product to carry its complete digital identity from cradle to grave while creating new circular economy opportunities.

## Key Features

-   **AI-Powered Intelligence**: Leverage Google's Gemini models via Genkit for automated compliance checking, ESG scoring, supply chain risk analysis, and auto-generation of product descriptions and conformity declarations.
-   **Enterprise-Grade Security**: Built with a focus on security, all data integrity can be secured via blockchain anchoring for immutable proof of authenticity.
-   **Multi-Persona Dashboards**: A multi-tenant system with distinct, feature-rich dashboards and granular permissions for 10 unique roles, including Suppliers, Auditors, Compliance Managers, Service Providers, and Manufacturers.
-   **Global Supply Chain Visualization**: An interactive 3D globe tracker to visualize product transit routes, customs alerts, and supply chain networks in real-time.
-   **Seamless Integration**: A developer-friendly GraphQL API, a versioned REST API, and a webhook system for real-time notifications and integration with external ERPs or e-commerce platforms.
-   **Advanced Trust Hub**: A dedicated control center for managing the cryptographic lifecycle of products, including on-chain anchoring, Verifiable Credential (VC) issuer status, and Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) generation.

## Tech Stack

-   **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (with App Router)

-   **Blockchain & Trust Layer**: [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) for low-cost, energy-efficient Ethereum Layer 2 anchoring.
-   **UI**: [React](https://reactjs.org/), [ShadCN UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
-   **Testing**: [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/)

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project running on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v20 or later)
-   npm or yarn
-   Firebase CLI (`npm install -g firebase-tools`)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-name>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    
3.  **Set up Environment:**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project. For local development, this file can be mostly empty, but it's required. For production deployment, you will need to add your Firebase configuration keys.
    ```bash
    touch .env.local
    ```
    Your `.env.local` file should look like this:
    ```env
    # This flag tells the Firebase client SDK to connect to the local emulators.
    NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_FIREBASE_EMULATOR=true
    
    # (Optional) Firebase client configuration (for production/preview)
    # NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=...
    # NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=...
    # NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=...
    # NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=...
    # NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=...
    # NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=...
    
    # Secret for securing cron job endpoints
    # CRON_SECRET=...
    
    # (Optional) Blockchain Integration Variables for Data Anchoring
    # You will need these to test the blockchain anchoring feature.
    # Get a free RPC URL from providers like Alchemy or Infura for the Polygon Amoy testnet.
    # POLYGON_AMOY_RPC_URL=...
    # The private key of the wallet that will pay for testnet gas fees.
    # IMPORTANT: Use a dedicated, testnet-only wallet with minimal funds.
    # WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=...
    # The address of your deployed smart contract on the Amoy testnet.
    # A sample contract is not provided, but the code expects a contract
    # with a `registerPassport(bytes32, bytes32)` function.
    # SMART_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=...
    ```

### Running the Application

To run the full application, including the Next.js frontend, the Firebase emulators, and the Genkit AI tools, use a single command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command uses the Firebase CLI to concurrently start all necessary services:
-   **Firebase Emulators**: Firestore, Auth, Storage, and Functions.
-   **Genkit Developer UI**: The AI flow debugger, accessible at `http://localhost:4000`.
-   **Next.js Frontend**: The main web application, accessible at `http://localhost:9002`.

All services will run in the same terminal, and you will see logs from all of them.

### Interactive Demo

To quickly explore the different user roles and dashboards, you can use the interactive demo page. Navigate to:

`http://localhost:9002/demo`

From there, you can log in as any of the 10 pre-configured user personas to experience their unique workflow and features.

## Testing

The platform includes a testing suite using Jest.

-   **Run all tests in watch mode:**
    ```bash
    npm run test
    ```
-   **Run tests for a CI environment (single run):**
    ```bash
    npm run test:ci
    ```
