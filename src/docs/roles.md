## Workflow Example: New Product Creation

1.  A **Supplier** creates a new product passport and submits it for verification. The product status is `Draft` and verification status is `Pending`.
2.  An **Auditor** sees the new product in their queue. They review the data and approve it. The verification status changes to `Verified`.
3.  The **Supplier** can now change the product status to `Published`.
4.  If a scheduled check by the **System** later finds an issue, the verification status changes to `Failed`.
5.  A **Compliance Manager** is notified of the flagged product and works with the **Supplier** to resolve the issue.

# 8. Vertical-Specific Go-to-Market (GTM) and Regulatory Mapping
Electronics and Textiles (ESPR) Alignment: Under the EU’s Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR), electronics and textiles are among the first sectors slated for mandatory digital product passports [circularise.com](http://circularise.com) [circularise.com](http://circularise.com). The DPP platform needs to map its data fields to the requirements of these verticals. For electronics (e.g. smartphones, appliances), key fields likely include energy efficiency data, repairability scores, and hazardous substance content. The passport should incorporate any existing labeling info – for example, many electronics already have an energy label or repair score; the DPP can digitize that and provide deeper detail like component materials, firmware version, carbon footprint, etc. ESPR for electronics emphasizes material provenance and the ease of disassembly/recycling [climatiq.io](http://climatiq.io). Thus, a passport for an electronic device might have sections for: Bill of Materials (with links to sub-component passports or at least descriptions of plastic vs metal content), Carbon Footprint of production, Energy consumption during use, Repair and Spare Parts Info (perhaps a link to repair manuals or availability of spare parts), and End-of-life handling instructions. These map to ESPR’s sustainability and circularity criteria. For textiles, the focus is on fiber composition, origin, and recyclability. A textile passport would list materials (e.g. 60% cotton, 40% polyester), possibly the country of origin of the fibers or where it was manufactured, any sustainability certifications (like GOTS for organic cotton or OEKO-TEX for chemical safety). It would also include care instructions (which relate to longevity) and end-of-life suggestions (like if the garment is part of a take-back scheme). The ESPR’s goal of transparency means the DPP must surface data that today might be hidden deep in supply chains, such as dye chemicals used (if relevant to recyclers or reusers). The core DPP data model can accommodate these via extensible fields or linked resources. In mapping these fields, the platform team should reference the draft delegated acts or working plan for ESPR: for instance, by 2025 the EU is defining specific passport content for textiles and furniture [climatiq.io](http://climatiq.io) [climatiq.io](http://climatiq.io). Electronics might surprisingly not require DPP initially (because they have existing labels) [climatiq.io](http://climatiq.io), but it’s expected that as circular economy measures progress, even electronics will get additional DPP mandates for things like smartphones. The DPP platform’s flexibility allows supporting these early voluntarily, giving electronics clients a head start in compliance and branding. We ensure fields like “product category per EC regulations” are included so that each passport is tagged if it’s, say, “Energy-related product per Ecodesign lot X” or “Textile product as per ESPR Annex”. This helps dynamically apply the right rules in verification apps (e.g., an app could highlight the repair score for electronics or the material origin for textiles specifically). Chemical Products (REACH/BPR) Mapping: The term BPR (chemicals) in our context likely refers to regulations around chemicals (possibly the Biocidal Products Regulation, or more generally EU chemicals regulations like REACH and CLP). While a can of chemicals or a substance isn’t a “product” in the usual sense, the EU is considering DPP-like requirements for complex chemical products or mixtures (the climatiq update notes that the plan for chemicals passports is under study due to complexity [climatiq.io](http://climatiq.io)). In preparation, the DPP platform should accommodate chemical safety and compliance information. For example, a passport for a chemical product (like a paint, detergent, or battery electrolyte) would need fields for: Chemical Composition (perhaps linking to CAS numbers or EU Chemical Inventory IDs), Safety Data (hazard pictograms, CLP hazard statements), Regulatory Authorizations (if it’s a biocide, the authorization number under BPR, if it’s a polymer, any REACH registration info). ECHA (European Chemicals Agency) plays a key role here – the platform could integrate with ECHA databases to pull hazard information or to ensure consistency of substance identifiers. For instance, if a product passport says it contains “Substance XYZ”, the platform could verify if XYZ is on the Candidate List of SVHC (Substances of Very High Concern) and flag that. The SCIP database (Substances of Concern In Products) requirement under waste law already mandates manufacturers to declare if products contain SVHCs above 0.1%. A chemicals-oriented DPP would naturally include the SCIP info (SCIP number, etc.), effectively becoming the vehicle to fulfill that requirement. Additionally, the Biocidal Products Regulation (BPR) could utilize DPPs to share usage and safety info for biocidal products – e.g., a digital passport that shows the active substance, its approval number, expiration of approval, proper usage instructions, etc. The mapping exercise here ensures that any data field required by chemical regulations can be represented. The platform might define a “ChemicalPassport” profile with specific schema for these (like sections for Hazard Classification, Safe Use Guidelines, Disposal Instructions). Partnering with ECHA could accelerate this – the passport could even link to ECHA’s public info pages for each substance to provide up-to-date hazard info. Another element is tracking regulatory changes: chemicals get new restrictions often, so a passport might need to be updated or flagged if a substance in it becomes restricted (this ties back to the revocation/update discussion: a chemical passport might be “revoked” or marked non-compliant after a certain date if regs change). The platform thus should include compliance checks and maybe push notifications to issuers for any such needed updates (e.g., “Substance X in your product was newly restricted, you must update the passport with new compliance measures”). Construction Products (CPR) Mapping: The Construction Products Regulation (CPR) requires that construction products (like steel beams, cement, cables, etc.) have a Declaration of Performance and CE marking indicating compliance with harmonized standards. A Digital Product Passport for construction products would digitize the Declaration of Performance (DoP) and related info. That means fields such as: Mechanical properties (strength, load ratings), Fire resistance class, Thermal performance, Relevant harmonized standard number, and Notified Body certificate details. Essentially, all the information that currently goes into the paper/pdf DoP and the product label can be structured into the passport. This is hugely beneficial on large projects: imagine a digital twin of a building where each component’s passport is accessible – facility managers and inspectors can quickly retrieve performance specs and compliance certificates. The DPP platform should map CPR-required fields to passport claims. For example, CPR might say a cable must list its Euroclass for fire (e.g., B2ca), the passport would have an entry “Fire Reaction Class: B2ca (per EN 50575)”. It might also link to the test report or the Notified Body that certified it. Since construction products can have long lifespans, the passport might also include warranty info or maintenance guidelines, bridging into lifecycle data. We should engage with industry standards bodies like CEN (European Committee for Standardization) who often specify how product info should be presented – the DPP should adhere to those formats (for instance, using standard property codes from IFC or buildingSMART if relevant). By mapping to CPR, the platform not only ensures compliance but also helps clients (manufacturers) by essentially automating their DoP: once data is in the DPP, it can generate a compliant DoP document if needed for legacy processes, while also serving the digital use-case. Stakeholder Journey Mapping per Vertical: Each industry has different primary actors who will create and use the DPP. For batteries (covered under the new Battery Regulation), the key stakeholders include battery manufacturers, importers, EV producers integrating batteries, recyclers, and regulators. A likely journey: a battery manufacturer issues a Battery Passport (with all required data points) when producing a battery. If that battery is installed in an EV, the EV maker might need to incorporate the battery’s passport into the vehicle’s passport or at least reference it. Upon import into the EU, importers must ensure the passport is present and complete – customs or market surveillance might verify it. Later, when the battery is sent for recycling, the recycler scans the passport to see the composition (like how much cobalt, etc.) and update the passport with end-of-life info. The DPP platform should facilitate these interactions: e.g., allow an importer to attach their declaration that they complied with due diligence (the Battery Regulation requires due diligence for supply chain of critical raw materials – this could be a credential itself that gets linked to the passport [climatiq.io](https://climatiq.io)). For textiles, stakeholders include fashion brands, certification bodies (for organic/fair trade/etc.), retailers, consumers, and recyclers. A typical journey: a certifier issues credentials for raw materials (e.g., a cotton bale gets an organic certificate VC). The garment manufacturer, when creating the product passport, pulls in those credentials (perhaps embedding or referencing the material certificates) along with their own data (factory, labor standards, etc.). The brand then makes the DPP available via a QR code on the clothing label for consumers to scan. A consumer might use their phone or EUDI wallet to scan the QR in a store to see sustainability info. Later, a thrift store or reseller might scan the code to update ownership (if we allow an ownership transfer log), or a recycling sorter might scan it to determine material recycling method. The platform needs to support chained credentials in this journey – for instance, linking the product DPP with separate credentials from third parties (like a OEKO-TEX chemical safety certificate issued by a lab, or a FairTrade certificate for a batch of cotton). We should map out how those are verified and presented (perhaps the DPP can present a summary but link to the full third-party credential for detail). This increases trust: a claim of “organic cotton” can be backed by an actual verifiable credential from the certifier, viewable in the passport [gs1uk.org](https://gs1uk.org) (the Loake shoemaker example shows pulling in sourcing info and sustainability credentials into a customer-facing page). Stakeholder mapping ensures we don’t design just for the issuer, but also for these other roles. For example, enabling battery importers to use the platform might mean giving them a portal or API to quickly lookup passports by serial number to include in their import filings. For textile certifiers, it might mean giving them a way to plug their certification issuance into the DPP data flow (so that certificates are automatically linked with product records via maybe material batch IDs). Regulatory Field Mapping Examples: As a quick mapping reference, consider the EU Battery Passport requirements which are well-defined for 2026/27. They include: battery identifiers, manufacturer info, production date and place, chemistry, capacity, performance metrics, carbon footprint data, recycled content, supply chain due diligence info, and end-of-life info [climatiq.io](https://climatiq.io). Our DPP data model should have slots for all these (and indeed treat it as a minimum for any electronics battery product). For textiles, likely fields: material breakdown, production country, supplier identity (maybe hidden but accessible to regulators), product environmental footprint (there’s talk of a PEF), durability (number of washes), and possibly a repairability index if relevant. For construction products: all properties from the DoP, plus maybe an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) which is like a carbon footprint for construction materials. The DPP could incorporate the EPD data in a standardized way (there are EN standards for EPDs that could be adhered to). By aligning each vertical’s passport content with these regulatory and industry standards, we make the platform much more useful and acceptable. It means that when a regulation comes into force, our clients can be confident their passports are already compliant. Industry Partnerships and Ecosystem Acceleration: To achieve this vertical adoption, partnering with key industry bodies is essential. GS1 is one such partner for cross-sector standardization. By using GS1 identifiers (like GTIN for products) and GS1 Digital Link as the mechanism for QR codes, the DPP platform ensures interoperability and scalability. The GS1 Digital Link standard allows embedding a URL/URI in a QR that can point to online data – our platform can either host that data or provide a redirect to a specific DPP API endpoint [gs1uk.org](https://gs1uk.org). GS1’s involvement also helps on the supply chain side: standards like EPCIS (for event capture) can feed into DPPs so that movements of a product are recorded. The example of Loake (shoes brand) working with GS1 UK shows the benefit: each shoe had a GS1 QR code linking to a unique product page with materials and sustainability info [gs1uk.org](https://gs1uk.org). That’s effectively a simple DPP in action, and it used GS1 standards. We will continue working with GS1 to refine how to encode DPP access in standard barcodes and RFID – including how ISO 15459 identifiers are used (this ISO is mentioned in DPP context for unique IDs [climatiq.io](https://climatiq.io) [climatiq.io](https://climatiq.io)). ECHA (European Chemicals Agency) is another key partner, particularly for the chemicals vertical and for environmental reporting. Partnering with ECHA could mean connecting the DPP platform with ECHA’s databases. For example, when an issuer is filling in chemical info for a product, a built-in integration could allow them to search the ECHA database for the substance and automatically fetch its proper designation and any hazard flags. Also, ECHA might use the anonymized data from DPPs to better understand chemicals in products in the market (synergy in regulatory monitoring). ZVEI (the German Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers’ Association) and similar industry associations (like DigitalEurope, IPC for electronics, etc.) can help drive adoption in their sectors. ZVEI has even proposed an architecture called DPP4.0 aligning with Industry 4.0’s Asset Administration Shell [zvei.org](https://zvei.org). By collaborating with ZVEI, we ensure the platform can integrate with manufacturing systems that use the Asset Administration Shell (digital twin) concept – meaning our DPP data model could be one and the same as the AAS submodel for product passport, enabling German and EU manufacturers to adopt it without reinventing data structures. ZVEI and other bodies (like ZVEI’s counterpart in other countries, or sector-specific bodies like automotive’s CATENA-X for circularity) can pilot the DPP with member companies. Another example, ECHA and battery industry: the Battery Passport initiative (under Global Battery Alliance) involves many stakeholders; aligning with those standards and possibly providing our platform as an implementation helps accelerate usage. Ecosystem play also means working with solution providers: maybe partnering with major PLM/ERP vendors (SAP has a sustainability module, Siemens Teamcenter etc.) to embed DPP generation in their tools. In terms of GTM, each vertical can have a tailored story: e.g., for electronics, pitch DPP as a way to comply with ESPR and as a way to reduce e-waste by improving repair flows; for textiles, pitch it as compliance with upcoming regulations and a way to build consumer trust (traceability of organic materials, etc.); for chemicals, focus on safety compliance and streamlined reporting (no more redundant safety datasheets if passport is always available). By mapping regulations to DPP fields and engaging the right partners, we make the platform future-proof and indispensable. As new laws (like upcoming ones for packaging or furniture) come, we just add the specific required fields – the underlying architecture (smart contracts, credential framework) remains the same, only the schema or templates expand. This modularity in documentation will help both product teams (to know what to include for each sector) and engineering teams (to configure validations and data model accordingly). In summary, the DPP platform’s extended documentation now provides a comprehensive blueprint for advanced features (from smart contracts to integration) and concrete alignment with regulatory needs. It ensures that as our clients move towards long-term scalability and compliance, the platform can support them with robust architecture, clear integration paths, and ready-made mappings to the rules that govern their industries. Each section of this document can be further expanded with technical specifications or code samples as needed, but this high-level overview maps the critical areas for investor readiness and strategic development in the Digital Product Passport initiative.

# 9. User Journeys

Our platform serves a variety of user types, primarily falling into two groups: Enterprise customers (large organizations with existing systems and complex needs) and SME/Startup/Midmarket customers (smaller companies or new ventures who need quick, low-code solutions). We design user journeys to cater to both, ensuring that each type of user can easily onboard and get value from the DPP platform.

## 9.1 Enterprise vs SME Portal Features

### Access control (RBAC vs ABAC)
We implement a flexible access model that combines role-based (RBAC) and attribute-based (ABAC) controls. In RBAC, users have predefined roles (Admin, Issuer, Auditor, etc.) which grant fixed permissions. In ABAC, decisions also consider attributes like user department or product category. Enterprise portals will use full RBAC, while SME portals will use simpler presets. We also support ABAC: for instance, only users from the “Recycling” department might see end-of-life data.

### Permission model logic
Within the portal we define who can edit, sign, anchor, and archive a DPP. Typically:
*   **Edit/Create**: Only the product owner (manufacturer) or delegated partner can create or modify the DPP content.
*   **Sign**: Each data entry or version is signed by its author; finalizing a version requires an authorized signature.
*   **Anchor**: A blockchain anchoring transaction (on EBSI or L2) can only be triggered by a user with “Registrar” permission.
*   **Archive**: Once a product is decommissioned, archiving rights (often read-only thereafter) go to a compliance officer or auditor role.

### UI/UX differences
The enterprise dashboard offers full visibility: multiple company accounts, detailed compliance status, analytics, and customizable reports. It integrates warnings and “AI explainability” hints. The SME interface is streamlined: wizards for DPP creation, template-based entry forms, and simpler visualization of compliance gaps. Both UIs highlight regulatory warnings (color-coded) next to data fields.

### Onboarding, audit trail & versioning
Every user action is logged. When an enterprise user onboards, they get SSO/SAML access and are assigned a role; SMEs may use email/password signup with automated KYC. The portal maintains an immutable audit trail (who changed what and when) for each DPP. Every time a DPP VC is re-issued or edited, the old version is archived and a new version is chained. This means auditors can trace the entire history of a product passport.
