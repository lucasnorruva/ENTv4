# 8. Vertical-Specific Go-to-Market (GTM) and Regulatory Mapping
Electronics and Textiles (ESPR) Alignment: Under the EU’s Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR), electronics and textiles are among the first sectors slated for mandatory digital product passports [circularise.com](http://circularise.com) [circularise.com](http://circularise.com). The DPP platform needs to map its data fields to the requirements of these verticals. For electronics (e.g. smartphones, appliances), key fields likely include energy efficiency data, repairability scores, and hazardous substance content. The passport should incorporate any existing labeling info – for example, many electronics already have an energy label or repair score; the DPP can digitize that and provide deeper detail like component materials, firmware version, carbon footprint, etc. ESPR for electronics emphasizes material provenance and the ease of disassembly/recycling [climatiq.io](http://climatiq.io). Thus, a passport for an electronic device might have sections for: Bill of Materials (with links to sub-component passports or at least descriptions of plastic vs metal content), Carbon Footprint of production, Energy consumption during use, Repair and Spare Parts Info (perhaps a link to repair manuals or availability of spare parts), and End-of-life handling instructions. These map to ESPR’s sustainability and circularity criteria. For textiles, the focus is on fiber composition, origin, and recyclability. A textile passport would list materials (e.g. 60% cotton, 40% polyester), possibly the country of origin of the fibers or where it was manufactured, any sustainability certifications (like GOTS for organic cotton or OEKO-TEX for chemical safety). It would also include care instructions (which relate to longevity) and end-of-life suggestions (like if the garment is part of a take-back scheme). The ESPR’s goal of transparency means the DPP must surface data that today might be hidden deep in supply chains, such as dye chemicals used (if relevant to recyclers or reusers). The core DPP data model can accommodate these via extensible fields or linked resources. In mapping these fields, the platform team should reference the draft delegated acts or working plan for ESPR: for instance, by 2025 the EU is defining specific passport content for textiles and furniture [climatiq.io](http://climatiq.io) [climatiq.io](http://climatiq.io). Electronics might surprisingly not require DPP initially (because they have existing labels) [climatiq.io](http://climatiq.io), but it’s expected that as circular economy measures progress, even electronics will get additional DPP mandates for things like smartphones. The DPP platform’s flexibility allows supporting these early voluntarily, giving electronics clients a head start in compliance and branding. We ensure fields like “product category per EC regulations” are included so that each passport is tagged if it’s, say, “Energy-related product per Ecodesign lot X” or “Textile product as per ESPR Annex”. This helps dynamically apply the right rules in verification apps (e.g., an app could highlight the repair score for electronics or the material origin for textiles specifically). Chemical Products (REACH/BPR) Mapping: The term BPR (chemicals) in our context likely refers to regulations around chemicals (possibly the Biocidal Products Regulation, or more generally EU chemicals regulations like REACH and CLP). While a can of chemicals or a substance isn’t a “product” in the usual sense, the EU is considering DPP-like requirements for complex chemical products or mixtures (the climatiq update notes that the plan for chemicals passports is under study due to complexity [climatiq.io](http://climatiq.io)). In preparation, the DPP platform should accommodate chemical safety and compliance information. For example, a passport for a chemical product (like a paint, detergent, or battery electrolyte) would need fields for: Chemical Composition (perhaps linking to CAS numbers or EU Chemical Inventory IDs), Safety Data (hazard pictograms, CLP hazard statements), Regulatory Authorizations (if it’s a biocide, the authorization number under BPR, if it’s a polymer, any REACH registration info). ECHA (European Chemicals Agency) plays a key role here – the platform could integrate with ECHA’s databases to pull hazard information or to ensure consistency of substance identifiers. For instance, if a product passport says it contains “Substance XYZ”, the platform could verify if XYZ is on the Candidate List of SVHC (Substances of Very High Concern) and flag that. The SCIP database (Substances of Concern In Products) requirement under waste law already mandates manufacturers to declare if products contain SVHCs above 0.1%. A chemicals-oriented DPP would naturally include the SCIP info (SCIP number, etc.), effectively becoming the vehicle to fulfill that requirement. Additionally, the Biocidal Products Regulation (BPR) could utilize DPPs to share usage and safety info for biocidal products – e.g., a digital passport that shows the active substance, its approval number, expiration of approval, proper usage instructions, etc. The mapping exercise here ensures that any data field required by chemical regulations can be represented. The platform might define a “ChemicalPassport” profile with specific schema for these (like sections for Hazard Classification, Safe Use Guidelines, Disposal Instructions). Partnering with ECHA could accelerate this – the passport could even link to ECHA’s public info pages for each substance to provide up-to-date hazard info. Another element is tracking regulatory changes: chemicals get new restrictions often, so a passport might need to be updated or flagged if a substance in it becomes restricted (this ties back to the revocation/update discussion: a chemical passport might be “revoked” or marked non-compliant after a certain date if regs change). The platform thus should include compliance checks and maybe push notifications to issuers for any such needed updates (e.g., “Substance X in your product was newly restricted, you must update the passport with new compliance measures”). The platform thus should include compliance checks and maybe push notifications to issuers for any such needed updates. Construction Products (CPR) Mapping: The Construction Products Regulation (CPR) requires that construction products (like steel beams, cement, cables, etc.) have a Declaration of Performance and CE marking indicating compliance with harmonized standards. A Digital Product Passport for construction products would digitize the Declaration of Performance (DoP) and related info. That means fields such as: Mechanical properties (strength, load ratings), Fire resistance class, Thermal performance, Relevant harmonized standard number, and Notified Body certificate details. Essentially, all the information that currently goes into the paper/pdf DoP and the product label can be structured into the passport. This is hugely beneficial on large projects: imagine a digital twin of a building where each component’s passport is accessible – facility managers and inspectors can quickly retrieve performance specs and compliance certificates. The DPP platform should map CPR-required fields to passport claims. For example, CPR might say a cable must list its Euroclass for fire (e.g., B2ca), the passport would have an entry “Fire Reaction Class: B2ca (per EN 50575)”. It might also link to the test report or the Notified Body that certified it. Since construction products can have long lifespans, the passport might also include warranty info or maintenance guidelines, bridging into lifecycle data. We should engage with industry standards bodies like CEN (European Committee for Standardization) who often specify how product info should be presented – the DPP should adhere to those formats (for instance, using standard property codes from IFC or buildingSMART if relevant). By mapping to CPR, the platform not only ensures compliance but also helps clients (manufacturers) by essentially automating their DoP: once data is in the DPP, it can generate a compliant DoP document if needed for legacy processes, while also serving the digital use-case. Stakeholder Journey Mapping per Vertical: Each industry has different primary actors who will create and use the DPP. For batteries (covered under the new Battery Regulation), the key stakeholders include battery manufacturers, importers, EV producers integrating batteries, recyclers, and regulators. A likely journey: a battery manufacturer issues a Battery Passport (with all required data points) when producing a battery. If that battery is installed in an EV, the EV maker might need to incorporate the battery’s passport into the vehicle’s passport or at least reference it. Upon import into the EU, importers must ensure the passport is present and complete – customs or market surveillance might verify it. Later, when the battery is sent for recycling, the recycler scans the passport to see the composition (like how much cobalt, etc.) and update the passport with end-of-life info. The DPP platform should facilitate these interactions: e.g., allow an importer to attach their declaration that they complied with due diligence (the Battery Regulation requires due diligence for supply chain of critical raw materials – this could be a credential itself that gets linked to the passport [climatiq.io](https://climatiq.io)). For textiles, stakeholders include fashion brands, certification bodies (for organic/fair trade/etc.), retailers, consumers, and recyclers. A typical journey: a certifier issues credentials for raw materials (e.g., a cotton bale gets an organic certificate VC). The garment manufacturer, when creating the product passport, pulls in those credentials (perhaps embedding or referencing the material certificates) along with their own data (factory, labor standards, etc.). The brand then makes the DPP available via a QR code on the clothing label for consumers to scan. A consumer might use their phone or EUDI wallet to scan the QR in a store to see sustainability info. Later, a thrift store or reseller might scan the code to update ownership (if we allow an ownership transfer log), or a recycling sorter might scan it to determine material recycling method. The platform needs to support chained credentials in this journey – for instance, linking the product DPP with separate credentials from third parties (like a OEKO-TEX chemical safety certificate issued by a lab, or a FairTrade certificate for a batch of cotton). We should map out how those are verified and presented (perhaps the DPP can present a summary but link to the full third-party credential for detail). This increases trust: a claim of “organic cotton” can be backed by an actual verifiable credential from the certifier, viewable in the passport [gs1uk.org](https://gs1uk.org) (the Loake shoemaker example shows pulling in sourcing info and sustainability credentials into a customer-facing page). Stakeholder mapping ensures we don’t design just for the issuer, but also for these other roles. For example, enabling battery importers to use the platform might mean giving them a portal or API to quickly lookup passports by serial number to include in their import filings. For textile certifiers, it might mean giving them a way to plug their certification issuance into the DPP data flow (so that certificates are automatically linked with product records via maybe material batch IDs). Regulatory Field Mapping Examples: As a quick mapping reference, consider the EU Battery Passport requirements which are well-defined for 2026/27. They include: battery identifiers, manufacturer info, production date and place, chemistry, capacity, performance metrics, carbon footprint data, recycled content, and due diligence info [climatiq.io](https://climatiq.io). Our DPP data model should have slots for all these (and indeed treat it as a minimum for any electronics battery product). For textiles, likely fields: material breakdown, production country, supplier identity, product environmental footprint (there’s talk of a PEF), durability (number of washes), and possibly a repairability index if relevant. For construction products: all properties from the DoP, plus maybe an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) which is like a carbon footprint for construction materials. The DPP could incorporate the EPD data in a standardized way (there are EN standards for EPDs that could be adhered to). By aligning each vertical’s passport content with these regulatory and industry standards, we make the platform much more useful and acceptable. It means that when a regulation comes into force, our clients can be confident their passports are already compliant. Industry Partnerships and Ecosystem Acceleration: To achieve this vertical adoption, partnering with key industry bodies is essential. GS1 is one such partner for cross-sector standardization. By using GS1 identifiers (like GTIN for products) and GS1 Digital Link as the mechanism for QR codes, the DPP platform ensures interoperability and scalability. The GS1 Digital Link standard allows embedding a URL/URI in a QR that can point to online data – our platform can either host that data or provide a redirect to a specific DPP API endpoint [gs1uk.org](https://gs1uk.org). GS1’s involvement also helps on the supply chain side: standards like EPCIS (for event capture) can feed into DPPs so that movements of a product are recorded. The example of Loake (shoes brand) working with GS1 UK shows the benefit: each shoe had a GS1 QR code linking to a unique product page with materials and sustainability info [gs1uk.org](https://gs1uk.org). That’s effectively a simple DPP in action, and it used GS1 standards. We will continue working with GS1 to refine how to encode DPP access in standard barcodes and RFID – including how to use ISO 15459 identifiers (this ISO is mentioned in DPP context for unique IDs [climatiq.io](https://climatiq.io) [climatiq.io](https://climatiq.io)). ECHA (European Chemicals Agency) is another key partner, particularly for the chemicals vertical and for environmental reporting. Partnering with ECHA could mean connecting the DPP platform with ECHA’s databases. For example, when an issuer is filling in chemical info for a product, a built-in integration could allow them to search the ECHA database for the substance and automatically fetch its proper designation and any hazard flags. Also, ECHA might use the anonymized data from DPPs to better understand chemicals in products in the market (synergy in regulatory monitoring). ZVEI (the German Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers’ Association) and similar industry associations (like DigitalEurope, IPC for electronics, etc.) can help drive adoption in their sectors. ZVEI has even proposed an architecture called DPP4.0 aligning with Industry 4.0’s Asset Administration Shell [zvei.org](https://zvei.org). By collaborating with ZVEI, we ensure the platform can integrate with manufacturing systems that use the Asset Administration Shell (digital twin) concept – meaning our DPP data model could be one and the same as the AAS submodel for product passport, enabling German and EU manufacturers to adopt it without reinventing data structures. ZVEI and other bodies (like ZVEI’s counterpart in other countries, or sector-specific bodies like automotive’s CATENA-X for circularity) can pilot the DPP with member companies. Another example, ECHA and battery industry: the Battery Passport initiative (under Global Battery Alliance) involves many stakeholders; aligning with those standards and possibly providing our platform as an implementation helps accelerate usage. Ecosystem play also means working with solution providers: maybe partnering with major PLM/ERP vendors (SAP has a sustainability module, Siemens Teamcenter etc.) to embed DPP generation in their tools. In terms of GTM, each vertical can have a tailored story: e.g., for electronics, pitch DPP as a way to comply with ESPR and as a way to reduce e-waste by improving repair flows; for textiles, pitch it as compliance with upcoming regulations and a way to build consumer trust (traceability of organic materials, etc.); for chemicals, focus on safety compliance and streamlined reporting (no more redundant safety datasheets if passport is always available). By mapping regulations to DPP fields and engaging the right partners, we make the platform future-proof and indispensable. As new laws (like upcoming ones for packaging or furniture) come, we just add the specific required fields – the underlying architecture (smart contracts, credential framework) remains the same, only the schema or templates expand. This modularity in documentation will help both product teams (to know what to include for each sector) and engineering teams (to configure validations and data model accordingly). In summary, the DPP platform’s extended documentation now provides a comprehensive blueprint for advanced features (from smart contracts to integration) and concrete alignment with regulatory needs. It ensures that as our clients move towards long-term scalability and compliance, the platform can support them with robust architecture, clear integration paths, and ready-made mappings to the rules that govern their industries. Each section of this document can be further expanded with technical specifications or code samples as needed, but this high-level overview maps the critical areas for investor readiness and strategic development in the Digital Product Passport initiative.

**Go-to-Market by Stakeholder Persona**

Our go-to-market strategy will tailor the value proposition of the DPP platform to different stakeholder personas, as each cares about different aspects:
- **Compliance Officers / Regulatory Affairs:** These stakeholders are primarily driven by the need to ensure compliance and avoid penalties. For them, the DPP platform is a compliance solution. Marketing message: “Stay ahead of regulations – our platform is your turnkey compliance for EU Digital Product Passport requirements.” We emphasize features like automatic validation against EU requirements, up-to-date schema that reflects the law, audit logs for regulators, and easy generation of compliance reports. Compliance officers will appreciate that the platform reduces the risk of fines or import/export blockage by ensuring each product has the required passport data. We should cite how regulators see DPPs: e.g., the European Commission says passports “improve transparency about products’ lifecycle impacts”, which helps with compliance. We offer peace of mind: when a new law kicks in, our customers can show they have all needed info in the correct format ready. GTM approach: webinars and whitepapers on “How to comply with the Digital Product Passport mandates in your industry” speaking directly to this audience. Possibly engage industry associations to recommend our solution to members for compliance.
- **Sustainability and CSR Leads:** These stakeholders are interested in using the DPP not only for compliance but to advance sustainability goals and brand reputation. The pitch here: DPP platform as a tool for transparency, trust, and optimization. We highlight how the platform aggregates data on material sourcing, carbon footprint, recyclability – giving the sustainability team actionable insights to improve product design and supply chain. For example, with all data in one passport, they can identify that certain components cause a high carbon footprint and target them for improvement. Also, sharing DPPs with customers builds brand trust (“look, we have nothing to hide about our product’s impact”). We emphasize features like carbon accounting integration, support for certifications (like Fair Trade, organic, etc. within the passport), and how it supports circular economy initiatives (e.g., enabling take-back schemes by scanning a product’s passport to see recycling info). Since sustainability leads often struggle to gather data from multiple silos, we show how our integration capabilities solve that, bringing procurement, manufacturing, and end-of-life data together. Essentially, the platform helps them measure and communicate sustainability – one of their key objectives. GTM tactics: case studies focusing on how using DPPs improved a company’s sustainability metrics or eased their ESG reporting. Also, position the platform as enabling compliance with not just DPP laws but also ESG disclosure regimes and voluntary commitments (like GRI or CDP reporting, where product-level data can feed into broader sustainability reporting).
- **IT Integrators / CIO / CTO:** For the technical audience, the focus is on integration, scalability, and security. Here we pitch the DPP platform as a modular, enterprise-grade software that will slot into their architecture. Key messages: it has open APIs, supports standards (JSON-LD, W3C Verifiable Credentials, OAuth, etc.), and can be deployed flexibly (cloud or on-prem) to meet IT policies. We address concerns like: “Will this work with our existing ERP/MES systems?” – Yes, we have connectors and an integration toolkit (we might mention our use of an iPaaS or API-first approach). “Is it secure and can it handle our scale?” – Yes, built on scalable cloud infrastructure, multi-tenant security, encryption, role-based access as per enterprise standards, and already tested with thousands of products. We also highlight our use of blockchain where applicable (some IT folks will be interested that we use decentralized tech for verification, though we clarify it's a permissioned chain like EBSI to calm any fears about public crypto stuff). Essentially, we make the IT stakeholder feel that adopting our platform is low-friction and will make them look good because it’s modern tech aligning with digital transformation goals. We can mention that our solution can increase efficiency – instead of building a custom system for DPP, which could take years, they can integrate ours in months and avoid diverting internal dev teams. Also, offering strong support and documentation (important to IT teams) and perhaps training for their staff or integration partners. GTM here might involve engaging systems integrators (Big 4 consultancies or niche firms) so that they recommend our platform during digital supply chain projects. Also, attending tech-oriented conferences, publishing technical whitepapers about our architecture's robustness.
- **Supply Chain & Operations Managers:** Another persona (not explicitly listed, but adjacent) might be those who handle product data day-to-day. Our approach to them: the platform makes their life easier by automating the assembly of passport data that they previously might have to chase manually. We might incorporate this into the above as secondary messages.

In practical terms, our sales and marketing strategy will have tailored materials for each persona:
- **For Compliance:** Emphasize risk mitigation and full compliance features, maybe with quotes like “Using [Platform], we achieved 100% compliance with the Battery Regulation ahead of deadline.”
- **For Sustainability:** Emphasize impact and transparency, e.g., “[Platform] enabled us to identify a 15% reduction in product carbon footprint by highlighting hotspots” or “...to confidently share product sustainability data with customers, boosting brand image.”
- **For IT:** Emphasize ease of implementation and future-proof tech, e.g., “We integrated [Platform] with our SAP and PLM in 6 weeks” or “The solution’s adherence to open standards meant no vendor lock-in and easy extension.”

Each stakeholder also has different buying triggers: compliance is often mandatory (budget appears to avoid fines), sustainability might need ROI argument (better brand loyalty, avoiding future compliance, etc.), IT might need TCO (total cost of ownership) comparison (cheaper to buy than build, plus ongoing support). We’ll prepare those arguments accordingly. By aligning our messaging to these stakeholders, we ensure during the sales process that each hears the aspects of the DPP platform that resonate with their concerns. Often the decision to adopt will involve all of them (e.g., a compliance officer says “we need this”, IT says “it fits our architecture”, sustainability says “it adds value to our goals”, and CFO signs off because each of those provided rationale). Hence a holistic but tailored GTM is key.
