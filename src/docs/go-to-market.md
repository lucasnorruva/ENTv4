# 8. Go-to-Market Strategy & Regulatory Alignment

## Vertical-Specific Go-to-Market (GTM)

The platform must bridge multiple regulatory schemes. This section outlines the specific GTM strategy for key international markets.

### European Union (EU)
- **Mandate**: The Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR) enforces DPPs, requiring products to carry them from 2026 onward (textiles first).
- **Platform Alignment**: The Norruva data model includes all ESPR-mandated fields, such as material composition, recyclability info, and carbon footprint data. EU rules apply equally to imports, broadening our scope to global suppliers.
- **GTM Focus**: Target EU-based companies and global suppliers who import into the EU, emphasizing turnkey ESPR compliance.

### United States (US)
- **Mandate**: The FTCâ€™s Green Guides demand substantiation for environmental marketing claims like "eco-friendly" or "recyclable."
- **Platform Alignment**: The `greenClaims` data structure in our product schema allows companies to link marketing claims directly to verifiable data (e.g., certification documents, LCA reports) within the DPP.
- **GTM Focus**: Position Norruva as a tool for "greenwashing" prevention and brand trust, helping companies meet FTC guidelines and build consumer confidence.

### Canada
- **Mandate**: Provincial Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) programs, aligned under the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (CCME), assign end-of-life responsibility to producers.
- **Platform Alignment**: The `compliance.epr` field in our data model captures the necessary data (scheme ID, producer number, waste category) for streamlined EPR reporting and fee calculation.
- **GTM Focus**: Target producers in regulated sectors (e.g., electronics, packaging) by offering a solution to simplify and automate their EPR compliance across different provinces.

### Asia-Pacific (APAC)
- **Mandate**: EPR laws for electronics and plastics are emerging in countries like Japan, South Korea, and India.
- **Platform Alignment**: The generic EPR fields in the DPP data model are flexible enough to accommodate the specific requirements of various APAC nations.
- **GTM Focus**: Offer a future-proof solution for multinational companies that need to manage compliance across a fragmented but growing regulatory landscape in Asia.

### Construction & Building Materials
- **Mandate**: The EU is phasing in DPP requirements for construction products starting in 2024 to address the sector's substantial environmental footprint.
- **Platform Alignment**: Our data model supports key metrics for building materials, such as embodied carbon, recycled content, and end-of-life options. The platform is designed to integrate with industry standards like BIMobject or RIBA data, allowing Building Information Models (BIM) to automatically populate the DPP.
- **GTM Focus**: Collaborate with construction industry groups and circular economy initiatives (e.g., EU BAMB project) to provide tools for manufacturers of cement, steel, and insulation to generate compliant passports.

## Data Interoperability Strategy

To enable global traceability and cross-certification, the platform uses common metadata standards.
- **Data Encoding**: All DPP data is structured using JSON-LD and linked-data vocabularies, referencing common schemas like `schema.org` and GS1 standards where applicable.
- **Product Identifiers**: The platform uses GTINs as the primary product identifier, with support for batch/serial numbers for granular traceability.
- **Hierarchical Data**: The system supports data inheritance, where facts asserted at a product group level (GTIN) can apply to all sub-units (batches, serials), reducing data duplication.

## Feature Mapping to Stakeholder Personas

To make the value proposition more concrete, this section maps specific platform features to the needs of each key stakeholder.

### For the Supplier
This persona is responsible for creating and maintaining product passports.
- **Guided Product Creation**: An intuitive form-based UI to create new DPPs, with AI assistance for generating descriptions (`generateProductDescription`) and parsing unstructured Bills of Materials (`analyzeBillOfMaterials`).
- **Data Quality Dashboard**: A dedicated view to see all products with AI-flagged data issues (`validateProductData`), with clear warnings and links to edit.
- **Pre-Submission Checklist**: An automated checklist that shows what data is missing before a passport can be submitted for verification, preventing simple errors.
- **Compliance Status Tracking**: A centralized dashboard to view the verification status of all products (Draft, Pending, Verified, Failed).

### For the Manufacturer
This persona is focused on production efficiency, supply chain visibility, and material management.
- **Production Line Dashboard**: A dashboard to monitor the status, output, and maintenance history of all manufacturing lines.
- **Material Composition Analytics**: Tools to analyze material usage across all products, track recycled content, and identify opportunities for more sustainable sourcing.
- **Supply Chain Provenance Viewer**: An interactive graph that visualizes the relationships between suppliers, components, and the final product.
- **Service Ticket Management**: The ability to create and track service tickets for production line maintenance.

### For the Fashion & Textile Specialist
This persona requires deep, industry-specific insights into garment manufacturing.
- **Specialized Data Entry**: A dedicated "Textile" tab for entering fiber composition, dye processes, and weave types.
- **AI-Powered Textile Analysis**: The `analyzeTextileComposition` flow assesses materials for microplastic shedding risk and evaluates dye safety against standards like ZDHC MRSL.
- **Targeted Compliance**: Helps address textile-specific regulations under ESPR, such as recycled content verification and end-of-life process management.

### For the Compliance Officer & Auditor
This persona requires tools for risk mitigation, verification, and reporting.
- **Global Supply Chain Tracker**: An interactive 3D globe to visualize product transit routes, monitor for customs alerts, and proactively identify cross-border compliance risks.
- **Automated Validation Engine**: The AI-powered `summarizeComplianceGaps` flow automatically checks products against assigned paths.
- **Flagged Products Queue**: A dedicated dashboard to view and manage all products that have failed verification.
- **Immutable Audit Logs**: A complete, verifiable history of every action taken on a product passport, crucial for regulatory inquiries.
- **AI-Generated Declaration of Conformity**: The `generateConformityDeclaration` flow creates standardized, formal compliance documents with one click.
- **Data Export Center**: Generate CSV reports of compliance status across all products for internal or external auditing.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Ensures a clear separation of duties between data entry (Suppliers) and verification (Auditors).
