# 3. Compliance Matrix: Standards & Regulations

Digital Product Passports must link to various global and EU regulations. Below is a sample mapping table of key regulations (with their scope, relevant data fields, and how they align with DPP data). This table can be extended or customized. We also provide a corresponding JSON schema snippet for integration. The DPP is designed to include “compliance documentation” for laws on substances and sustainability [data.europa.eu](https://data.europa.eu), so each entry below shows which DPP fields (e.g. material compositions, certificates) feed into regulatory compliance.
