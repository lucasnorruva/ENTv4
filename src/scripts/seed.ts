// This is a placeholder for a database seeding script.
// The application is currently configured to use in-memory mock data,
// so no seeding is required.
//
// To re-enable Firestore seeding, you would typically:
// 1. Add your Firebase Admin SDK initialization code here.
// 2. Write functions to populate your Firestore collections.
// 3. Run this script via tsx or an npm script.
